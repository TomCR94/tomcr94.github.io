Welcome to the Blog, and Happy 2021 if you’re here early

While it does feel like business as usual, still working from home, still figuring out how best to organise the office furniture, is still is a New Year.

Might as well take the ‘clean slate’ feeling of that new years period and run with it.

I’ll introduce myself properly over the next few months, a post here and there, some technical and some cultural, giving an insiders view on how a DevOps transformation happpens, stumbles and all.

To start, I’m going to polish and post a walkthrough of how this blog itself comes together, a combination of Dockerised Development Environments, an unfamiliar language, and how to cut out the hard parts of getting setup.
