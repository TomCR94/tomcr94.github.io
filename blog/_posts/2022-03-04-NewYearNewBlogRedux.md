Welcome to the Blog, and Happy 2022... This seems familiar

After a 2021 that ran on as weirdly and unexpectedly as 2020, the idea of starting a blog and getting some of my more interesting DevOps achievements out into the world died a quick death

So, here in February of 2022, I'm going to try again. This time with the gentle encouragement of my partner, the plan is to at least have something to post each month

Last time I promised a guide on how this blog comes together using various technology. This will still be my first post, and should be better still since I've had to learn it all again after a year of forgetting. I also want to push out posts on some more obscure or technical usages of Azure DevOps that I have had to implement since I started as a DevOps engineer

And while I know `DevOps != Azure DevOps`, the day to day is still rooted in tooling rather than culture
